How do I interpret user needs and implement them into a program? How does creating “user stories” help with this?

A user or collection of users use programs to simplify tasks or do tasks that are not as easily accomplished without a program. A user story is a statement that
simplifies what kind of person takes a type of action to accomplish a task. For example. As an end user, I want to click a link to find my favorite food. A simple 
statement that says who you are, what you are doing, and what the expeceted results are. These user stories are turned into PBI's or product backlog items by the
product owner for developers or teams of developers to work on. The product owner helps the team understand what work needs to be done and presents it as a product
backlog. 

How do I approach developing programs? What agile processes do I hope to incorporate into my future development work?

As of right now my approach to developing programs is kind of a mix between waterfall and agile. It leans both ways based on the type of project being done. I aim to
become more agile based rather than waterfall method but will still take more of a waterfall style on simpler tasks. No two situations are the same. What I learn today
may be the most efficient today but may be considered obsolete within 2 days or 2 years. Technology is always evolving. This applies to hardware, software, and
the fundamentals of programming. Regardless of the project I hope to become more efficient in test driven development and project planning. I kind of just dive in
to the work right now although throughout this short programming certification course I have gotten better at breaking down tasks and planning out my work. I'm not great
with flowcharts for planning however am decent with pseudocode. Using pseudocode, test driven development, and other agile principles, my workflow has improved.

What does it mean to be a good team member in software development?

A good team member is responsible for the work that they do and can thoroughly explain that work. Being a good team member includes, attendance,
accountability, and support. You always share your knowledge if you see someone who doesn't know something that you do.You should always be available when  you are
supposed to be available. Part of being responsible for your work is communicating what you can do, can't do, or have already done. If you have completed something
and you know you are not available to eplain what you did then you should make sure that someone else knows what you accomplished because chances are what you worked
on has an impact on the overall progress of the project
